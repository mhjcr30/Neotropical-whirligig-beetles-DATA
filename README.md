# Microstructural and Pigmentary Contributions to Coloration in Neotropical Whirligig Beetles

This repository contains the source code and supporting data required to reproduce selected figures from the manuscript:

> **Microstructural and pigmentary contributions to coloration in Neotropical whirligig beetles (Coleoptera: Gyrinidae)**

submitted to **PeerJ**.

## Repository contents

### Figure 4

Figure 4 can be reproduced using the Python notebook:

- `/Code/Python/Diffraction colors/diffractionv2.ipynb`

### Figure 5

Figure 5 can be reproduced using the Python notebooks:

- `/Code/Python/Spectra-averages/DS_plot.ipynb`
- `/Code/Python/Spectra-averages/GC_plots.ipynb`

These notebooks use the raw reflectance spectra located in:

```
Data/Spectra/
```

### Supplementary Figures S1-1 and S1-2

Supplementary Figures S1-1 and S1-2 can be reproduced using the MATLAB script:

- `/Code/Matlab/spacings_FB.m`

The script requires the peak position data located in:

```
Data/Data_for_spacingFB/
```

## Software requirements

### MATLAB

The MATLAB scripts were developed and tested using

- MATLAB R2023b Update 5

### Python

The Python notebooks were developed and executed using

- Google Colaboratory (Google Colab)
